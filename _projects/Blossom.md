Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) serves as a bridge between past, present, and future. For ICH traditions that have experienced historical disruptions, ancient texts and paintings provide invaluable insights. However, current VR systems for ICH often focus on static preservation, while AI applications remain largely limited to archival and documentation tasks. We present Timeless Blossoms, an AI-assisted VR system that enables practitioners to engage in realistic 3D flower arrangement while witnessing their Traditional Chinese Flower Arrangement (TCFA) compositions transform into 2D Xieyi (Chinese expressive) paintings in real time. By enabling participants to engage in a cross-temporal and cross-medium creative process, Timeless Blossoms offers a novel approach to cultural heritage preservation through AI and VR.  Our work advances the discourse on AI-assisted cultural creativity by demonstrating how computational techniques can bridge diverse artistic expressions within ICH experiences.
