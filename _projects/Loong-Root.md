~~coming soon ðŸ¤«~~

This project is an artifact created as a tribute for a man's 60th birthday. The design tried to harmoniously integrate the _Wu Xing_ (Five Elements), the _Chinese Zodiac_ (Loong), and the _Chinese character_ "æ ¹" (Root). Key elements include the harmony of the Five Elements, root carving, mountains, rocks, a pond, lotus flowers, koi fish, and a traditional Wupeng boat. The crafting process involves 3D printing, resin curing, sanding, and polishing.
