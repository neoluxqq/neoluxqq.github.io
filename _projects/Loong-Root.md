~~coming soon 🤫~~

This project is an artifact created as a tribute for my [👨🏻](future father-in-law) 's 60th birthday. The design tried to harmoniously integrate the *Wu Xing* (Five Elements), the *Chinese Zodiac* (Loong), and the *Chinese character* "根" (Root). Key elements include the harmony of the Five Elements, root carving, mountains, rocks, a pond, lotus flowers, koi fish, and a traditional Wupeng boat. The crafting process involves 3D printing, resin curing, sanding, and polishing.
