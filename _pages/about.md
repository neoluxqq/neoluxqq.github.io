Greetings! I am Qingqin Liu, 刘晴钦 in Chinese, a PhD student at the <a href='https://meilab-hk.github.io/index.html'>Multimodal and Embodied Interaction (MEI) Lab</a> at City University of Hong Kong. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://zhukening.wixsite.com/aboutme'>Prof. Kening Zhu</a>. I received my Master’s degree in Communication from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was mentored by <a href='https://dblp.org/pid/117/0075-1.html'>Prof. Yanxiang Zhang</a>. Previously, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Astronomy at USTC 🌌

My research explores multimodal human-computer interaction by seamlessly integrating haptics, gestures and gaze across diverse platforms (handheld, head-mounted, mid-air). Focusing primarily on VR/AR/MR, I aim to create immersive and creative experiences that enrich everyday interactions. 
My work also extends to game interaction and playable interfaces, where I explore engaging design/development/user experience.
