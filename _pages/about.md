Greetings! I am Qingqin Liu, 刘晴钦 in Chinese, a PhD student at the <a href='https://meilab-hk.github.io/index.html'>Multimodal and Embodied Interaction (MEI) Lab</a> at City University of Hong Kong. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://zhukening.wixsite.com/aboutme'>Prof. Kening Zhu</a>. I hold a Master’s degree in Communication from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), where I was mentored by <a href='https://dblp.org/pid/117/0075-1.html'>Prof. Yanxiang Zhang</a>. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Astronomy at USTC 🌌

My research focuses on enabling human-computer interactions through diverse modalities(haptics, touch, gestures, gaze, etc.), across various devices (hand-held, head-mounted, midair, esp. VR/AR/MR). I am also passionate about game interaction and playable interfaces, encompassing game design, development, and player experience evaluation.
